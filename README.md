***Current news:***

  - May 3rd, 2025, 11:15 (UTC+1)/11:15 AM (UTC+2)

    - New! Support of ***Snapchat 13.39.0.44 for iOS*** (current release, support added only 2 hours after the release date)

    - The next available slots for new customers will be available around May 7th, 2025. Please contact us (see below).
   
    - The Snapchat account creator (mobile, iOS based) is available immediately. Please contact us (see below).

    - ***Very low entry prices*** starting at social US$ 470 (small package) and US$ 970 (standard package), for a limited time and limited number of new customers.

      We are known for ***very low entry prices***. To give everybody a chance to start, even people with a low budget.

      So you will be able to earn the first large bunch of money, ***grow organically in a healthy way*** and ***invest your future profits*** into upgrades, upcoming modules, new features etc.

      ***Don't fall for "unlimited" offers*** based on Android phones/emulators (signers, bridges) or browser emulations (web-snapchat-com)! There is nothing "unlimited" in data centers, colocation rooms, servers, switches, gateways, network uplinks, energy supplies, air condition, huge server housing companies. Sooner or later your Snapchat "provider" will be forced to cut you off.

      Please "star" and "watch" this GitHub repository to be notified on time about the limited sign up links and discounted entry prices.

    - Again we have to say that ***we can't provide free trainings, mentorings, consultings***. No matter which topic. Please contact us only if you are able to invest at least US$ 5,000 in a training/mentoring/consulting. 

    - Current information about a fake campaign:

      A small Snapchat bot (for Android only) provider from Russia pretends that members of our team do work/used to work as paid developers for him. That's not true.

      None of our team members ever worked as an external consultant, developer, reverse engineer, administrator etc. for any external company regarding Snapchat. Especially not supporting the poor Snapchat for Android variation everybody uses to spam (very high detection risk, high ban risk compared to Snapchat 13.x for iOS, low account lifetime).

      Since he operates his business from Russia and Russia has declared European countries the war more than 3 years ago (February 2022) our lawyers have no chance to start legal actions against him, his false advertising and also his blackmailing strategies. Our lawyers recommended us to take a different route instead. We will follow this advice soon.
    
    - ***No browser emulation***, we use the ***real Snapchat API for iOS***.
   
      As written below ***we don't use dirty tricks*** to ***jeopardize your earnings and Snapchat account lifetime***.

      We still don't use browser emulations (web-snapchat-com), cheap rooted Android phones, iOS jailbreaks, Android/iOS software emulators, bridges, signers, tweaks or other bulls__t.

      Instead we use our own, huge, customized ***dedicated hardware worth up to US$ 15,000 per machine.*** with large GPU units.

      Did you ever work with a brand new Apple Mac Pro, fully equipped, with the maximum possible configuration? ;-)
